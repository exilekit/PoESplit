## About
PoESplit is a timer program for players solo speedrunning the Path of Exile campaign. 

## Download
Windows Installers are provided on the [releases](https://github.com/exilekit/PoESplit/releases)
 page. We do not currently provide an installer for Linux or OSX platforms.

## How does it work?
PoESplit is an executable app that runs independently from the game, and monitors the game's log files. The act of monitoring the game's log files is explicitly permitted by the game's [Third-Party Policy](https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs) so long as the app discloses how that information is being used.

The game's log files contain (in real-time) when the player has performed specific actions (such as leveling up, changing zones, or allocating passives). PoESplit uses that information to provide on-screen metrics of your run.

It is the intent of the developer(s) of PoESplit (and its parent project, ExileKit) to adhere to the game's [Third-Party Policy](https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs) and [Terms of Use](https://www.pathofexile.com/legal/terms-of-use-and-privacy-policy).
